                        When despair for the world grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my childrens lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind starswaiting with their light. For a timeI rest in the grace of the world, and am free.

                        I am much too alone in this world, yet not alone enough to truly consecrate the hour.
                        I am much too small in this world, yet not small enough
                        to be to you just object and thing,
                        dark and smart.
                        I want my free will and want it accompanying
                        the path which leads to action;
                        and want during times that beg questions,
                        where something is up,
                        to be among those in the know,
                        or else be alone.
                        I want to mirror your image to its fullest perfection,
                        never be blind or too old
                        to uphold your weighty wavering reflection.
                        I want to unfold.
                        Nowhere I wish to stay crooked, bent;
                        for there I would be dishonest, untrue.
                        I want my conscience to be
                        true before you;
                        want to describe myself like a picture I observed
                        for a long time, one close up,
                        like a new word I learned and embraced,
                        like the everday jug,
                        like my mothers face,
                        like a ship that carried me along
                        through the deadliest storm.

                    <p>I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
                        Whatever I see I swallow immediately
                        Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
                        I am not cruel, only truthful,
                        The eye of a little god, four-cornered.
                        Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
                        It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
                        I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.
                        Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
                        Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
                        Searching my reaches for what she really is.
                        Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
                        I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
                        She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
                        I am important to her. She comes and goes.
                        Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
                        In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
                        Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

                        Every morning a new arrival.
                        
                        A joy, a depression, a meanness,
                        some momentary awareness comes
                        as an unexpected visitor.
                        
                        Welcome and entertain them all!
                        Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,
                        who violently sweep your house
                        empty of its furniture,
                        still, treat each guest honorably.
                        He may be clearing you out
                        for some new delight.
                        
                        The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
                        meet them at the door laughing,
                        and invite them in.
                        
                        Be grateful for whoever comes,
                        because each has been sent
                        as a guide from beyond.

                    “The Second Coming” <br> by William Butler Yeats

                <div class="poem-text-5-ins">
                    <p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre   
                        The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
                        Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
                        Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
                        The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
                        The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
                        The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
                        Are full of passionate intensity.
                        
                        Surely some revelation is at hand;
                        Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   
                        The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   
                        When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
                        Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   
                        A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
                        A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
                        Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
                        Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   
                        The darkness drops again; but now I know   
                        That twenty centuries of stony sleep
                        Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
                        And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
                        Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
